### Description

This is a collection of array practice problems for computer science 509 at Phillips Academy Andover, written in the language Swift. These problems were taken from sources such as [**Coding Bat**](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-2) and [**w3resource** ](https://w3resource.com/swift-programming-exercises/array/index.php#editorr). These problems range in difficulty and can be accessible for beginner coders learning the applications of arrays and more advanced students who enjoy testing their schools with fun challenge problems.
